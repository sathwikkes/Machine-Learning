##### Exploring the Evolution of Disney Films

With a history dating back to the 1930s and over 600 diverse film releases, Walt Disney Studios has catered to various audiences. This project delves into the data to analyze how the popularity of Disney movies has evolved over time. It also involves hypothesis testing to understand the factors influencing a movie's success.

Prerequisite skills include data manipulation with pandas, basic plotting using Seaborn, and proficiency in statistical inference, particularly conducting two-sample bootstrap hypothesis tests for mean differences.


##### Enhancing Business Strategies with Customer Segmentation

Customer segmentation is an essential strategy for tailoring marketing efforts, refining product offerings, and improving the overall customer experience. By leveraging the k-means clustering algorithm, this project addresses customer segmentation using the Online Retail dataset from the UCI ML repository. Data preprocessing is performed with the pandas library, while data clustering and visualization tasks are executed with scikit-learn and Plotly. The project showcases the practical application of k-means clustering to extract valuable insights from real-world data, guiding businesses to implement effective customer segmentation strategies for enhanced marketing and customer satisfaction.

##### Predicting Diabetes with Python Keras

In this project, we harness Python's Keras library to build neural networks for diabetes prediction using patient health data. We load, analyze, and visualize the data with pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn. Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature selection are performed before splitting it into training, validation, and testing datasets with NumPy. The project includes training simple deep learning models, plotting training curves, and evaluating models using scikit-learn.

##### Explore Stock Market Trends with Machine Learning and Python

In the ever-changing world of stock markets, predicting fluctuations is challenging due to numerous influencing factors. However, recent advancements in machine learning and data processing have made it possible to analyze historical stock data and forecast future trends.

This project harnesses Python to analyze a 13-year dataset of the NIFTY-50 stock market (2008â€“2021), publicly accessible on Kaggle. While the dataset includes around 50 stock files, this project will focus on visualizing the trends in one selected file.

##### Creating a Chatbot with Deep Learning

This project focuses on building a chatbot using deep learning techniques. The chatbot is trained on a dataset containing categories (intents), patterns, and responses. It utilizes a specialized recurrent neural network (LSTM) to categorize user messages and selects responses from a predefined list.


##### Enhancing Pedestrian Detection with Advanced Histograms of Oriented Gradients (HOG) in Computer Vision

Pedestrian detection stands at the core of computer vision, serving as a foundational element in visual understanding.

To delve into the workings of a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), it's essential to grasp the concepts of gradients and histograms.

In the realm of black and white imagery, the gradient quantifies the rate and direction of intensity change. Think of grayscale levels as analogous to elevation in a monochromatic landscape. A robust gradient, perpendicular to an image edge (a transition from black to white or vice versa), signifies a pronounced change in intensity perpendicular to the edge.

The system computes gradients for each pixel, and these gradients populate a histogram: the angle becomes the histogram value, and the magnitude becomes its weight. To discern whether cells within the present detection window correspond to a human presence, the system amalgamates the histograms of all cells and submits them to a machine learning discriminator.

It's crucial to note that this technique is tailored for detecting fully visible pedestrians in an upright position. Consequently, its efficacy may be limited in diverse scenarios.
